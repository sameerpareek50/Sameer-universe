    "Step 2: The Portfolio Website Code  \n",
    "I've created a single, self-contained HTML file for your portfolio. It includes all the necessary styling from Tailwind CSS and the JavaScript for the animated galaxy background. I've pulled all the relevant information from your resume and structured it into a clean, modern layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the complete code for your website. I'll explain what each part does below.  \n",

    "## How to Use This Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy the entire code block above.\n",
    "2. Paste it into the `index.html` file you created earlier.\n",
    "3. Save the file.\n",
    "4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (you can usually just double-click it).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see your portfolio website live on your local machine, complete with the animated galaxy background!\n",

    "## Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTML Structure:**  \n",
    "  The page is divided into semantic sections like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. This is good for organization and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Each section has an id (e.g., `id=\"projects\"`) which allows us to link to it directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tailwind CSS:**  \n",
    "  Instead of a separate CSS file, I've included Tailwind CSS directly from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). This line:  \n",
    "  `<script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>`  \n",
    "  does all the magic. We then use utility classes like `text-5xl`, `font-bold`, `bg-gray-800/50`, `rounded-lg`, etc., to style the elements directly in the HTML. This is a very fast and efficient way to build modern designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom CSS:**  \n",
    "  Inside the `<style>` tag, I've added a few custom styles to create the \"glass morphism\" effect for the cards and buttons (`background-color: rgba(...)`, `backdrop-filter: blur(...)`) and to set up the main background and font.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Galaxy Animation (JavaScript & three.js):**  \n",
    "  - We include the three.js library, which is a powerful 3D graphics library for JavaScript.\n",
    "  - The `<script>` at the bottom of the file sets up a scene, a camera, and a renderer.\n",
    "  - It then creates thousands of tiny white particles (Points) and positions them randomly to look like a starfield or galaxy.\n",
    "  - The animate function runs continuously, rotating the particles and subtly moving the camera based on your mouse position, which creates a cool parallax effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customize:**  \n",
    "  Feel free to change the text, add more projects, or tweak the colors. The beauty of this setup is that you can easily edit the content directly in the `index.html` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployment:**  \n",
    "  Once you're happy with your website, you'll want to put it online. There are many free and easy ways to do this:\n",
    "    - **GitHub Pages:** Since your code is likely to be on GitHub to showcase your projects, this is a natural fit. It's free and integrates perfectly.\n",
    "    - **Netlify:** Another excellent, user-friendly platform for deploying static websites.\n",
    "    - **Vercel:** Similar to Netlify, very popular and easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great starting point for your portfolio. It's professional, modern, and has that \"wow\" factor you were looking for. If you have any questions or want to add more features, just let me"
